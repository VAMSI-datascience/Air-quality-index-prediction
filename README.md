[This is the website where we are web scrapping the real time data for our quality index prediction](https://en.tutiempo.net/)

## This is a special project because it is not done on regualr datasets which are available to everyone, but we extracting our own data using web scrapping tools and we are using that real time data to predict the quality index..

+  The dataset comprises of data from 2 websites, one is from the above mentioned another is from the paid thirdparty api..
+  The data we are using is from 2013 to 2019 that is the pm2.5 value and we are downloading this data from third party api and it is paid one and there is a folder called AQI in our repository where the data collected can be seen..

+ In the second part of our data collection, as we can see that the pm2.5 values are given in a hourly basis and the data we are extracting is in daily basis.. The target for us is we need to find the avg value of the pm2.5 for 24 hours and make it as its daily value.. And that part can be seen in the plot.py file in the repo..
